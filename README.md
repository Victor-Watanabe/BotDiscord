# Discord Bot #

## Introduction ##
This project had a demand in which it was necessary to consult data in a Google Sheets file, thus welcoming users to a discord server and managing it.

## API Google Sheets ##
As already mentioned, it was necessary to use the Google Sheets API to query data, thus managing the entire server and providing restricted roles and access.

## Embeds in Discord ##
A message called "Embed" was coded to welcome all users who enter the server, making it more friendly and bringing the public closer to the Discord community. This message was personalized according to the preference of the requested demand, therefore, coded to the customer's satisfaction. Below is a demonstration.

## Create Adjustments for Your Use #

If you use this code, you will need to adapt it with your bot's access token, the channel through which the reception message should be deployed and the role that will be made available. In addition to locating the Google spreadsheet that should be made into a database! If no changes are made, you may respond with an error message!
